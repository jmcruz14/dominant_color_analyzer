# Movie Color Analyzer
Color analysis script written in Python to scan any movie file which is then converted accordingly into a color

## How the algorithm works
1. Insert any video file into the directory.
2. Open `index.py` and modify the `video` variable to point to the path of the video file.
3. Run `index.py` and you should see the output after several minutes, depending on the size of your video.

Sample outputs can be seen in the `samples` folder of the directory.
