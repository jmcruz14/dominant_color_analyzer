# Movie Color Analyzer
Color analysis script written in Python to scan any movie file which is then analyzed to obtain the five most frequent colors seen in the video file.

## Instructions for use
1. Insert any video file into the directory.
2. Open `index.py` and modify the `video` variable to point to the path of the video file.
3. Run `index.py` and you should see the output after several minutes, depending on the size of your video.

Sample outputs can be seen in the `samples` folder of the directory.

## Pending Updates
- [ ] Integrate as a function part of a web app (Streamlit/Vercel?)
- [ ] Explore ways to improve generation time (standard time: 1min vid / 10 min vid/ 30 min vid/ 1 hr vid)
